The D-Day Strategy

Strategy No. 1 — “D-Day”

The D-Day Strategy is designed to make real-time stock buying decisions based on instant market news.

Data Collection:
We begin by following multiple Telegram channels that post instant financial news and market updates.

Sentiment Analysis:
The collected news data is sent to three separate sentiment analysis models, each of which generates specific sentiment metrics (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral tone) related to the stock.

Metric Evaluation:
Based on the sentiment metrics, we assign point-based scores that indicate whether the stock shows potential for a buy signal or no-buy signal for the day.

Neural Network Decision Process:
These scores are then passed to three independent neural networks.

Each network evaluates the data and outputs a confidence value.

If the confidence value is below a defined threshold, the network suggests a no-buy decision; otherwise, it suggests a buy decision.

Final Decision Layer:
The outputs from the three neural networks are then fed into a final decision-making neural network, which aggregates and analyzes all inputs to make the ultimate buy or no-buy decision.

Learning Mechanism:
If the final prediction turns out to be incorrect, the system applies backpropagation to adjust the model weights and improve future decision accuracy.
